│   └── video.service.ts    # Metrics collection & submission
├── rewards/
│   └── reward.service.ts   # Automated reward distribution
└── admin/ (existing)
```

### **State Management**
```
src/stores/
└── gamification.store.ts   # Comprehensive Zustand store
```

### **Component Library**
```

- Missing React imports in some files

### **Production Readiness Tasks:**
1. **Fix TypeScript warnings** (1-2 hours)
2. **Configure TikTok API keys** (requires TikTok Developer account)
3. **Add missing database tables** (user_badges, xp_transactions, reward_distributions)
4. **Test OAuth flow end-to-end**

## 📋 **Immediate Next Steps**

### **For You:**
1. **Review the implementation** - Browse through the new components and features
2. **Test the admin panel** - Visit `/admin` to see contest management
3. **Configure TikTok Developer account** - Get API keys for full integration
4. **Review the analytics dashboard** - Check `/analytics` for creator insights

### **For Production Deployment:**
1. **Run database migrations** - Add the missing tables to Supabase
2. **Configure environment variables** - TikTok API keys and optional services
3. **Fix TypeScript warnings** - Clean up imports and type issues
4. **Deploy and test** - Verify OAuth flow and real-time features

## 🎯 **Business Impact**
